# Python Project Skeleton

This is example of basic Python project skeleton. This is useful when you are building libraries that have to be packaged and installed on other systems. Rename project name in `setup.py` and in the `src/` before you use it. The application can be bundled using `python setup.py sdist`. Project dependencies are managed using `pip-tools`.
